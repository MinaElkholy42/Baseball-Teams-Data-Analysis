# to get a total payroll 

# the Second Qeury 
# we Select Some of the Columns we will Use in the Analysis which are :->  
#  lgID (league), teamID, yearID, payroll, franchID, rank, W (games Won), G (Games played), and win_percentage
# Calculate the Win Precentage as new varaible using -> (Win Games / Total Games) * 100
