############################################### the Answer Of the Qeustion ########################################## 
#From this set of plots we can learn why the Oakland A’s were a 
#truely smart team and ahead of their time. As we can see from the 
#first graph ploted above ), “winning efficienct of teams over time seemed to 
#increase to an all time high in and then plateaued . 
#that over time, money seemed to have a high level of influence on how well a team would do. 
# In particular, as time went by, the regression line of payroll and winning percentage of 
# teams emmerged and we came to the conclusion in our regression line of all teams across all years 
#  that a team is predicted to win more than half of their games if they 
# spend more than average amount of payroll for their teams. Oakland is considered an 
# interesting team because they are an outlier to this trend. At least in their money ball period, 
# if we look at the time period from , we see that Oakland became more efficient 
# than any other team (. This means that they 
# were able to outperform in their games won (winning percentage) based off of their team payrolls.
#Based off of what they were paying, they were winning way more games than expected.
